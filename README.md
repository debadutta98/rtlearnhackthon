<b style="font-size:150px;">Problem statement</b>

Please create a simple PHP application that accepts a visitor’s email address and emails them random XKCD comics every five minutes.
Your app should include email verification to avoid people using others’ email addresses.
XKCD image should go as an email attachment as well as inline image content.
You can visit https://c.xkcd.com/random/comic/ programmatically to return a random comic URL and then use JSON API for details https://xkcd.com/json.html
Please make sure your emails contain an unsubscribe link so a user can stop getting emails.
Since this is a simple project it must be done in core PHP including API calls, recurring emails, including attachments should happen in core PHP. Please do not use any libraries.


NB: if you didn't find any mail then you can find it by searching your spam list.

Thank you
Happy coding 

Here is screenshot how the template look like
